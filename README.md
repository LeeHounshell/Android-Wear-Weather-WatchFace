Android Wear Weather WatchFace
==============================

I'm participating in the Udacity+Google Android Nanodegree program.
And this is the Android Wear Watch assignment for the Ubiquitous computing course.


## Description

This is an Android Wear WatchFace app. This is project 6 for the Udacity Android Nanodegree program.
This project extends the Udacity "Sunshine" weather app developed previously during the "Advanced Android Development" course.
The Sunshine app synchronizes weather information from OpenWeatherMap on Android Phones and Tablets and sends that to wear.
This watchface is configurable.


## Features
 * Weather background from Sunshine app shows weather conditions, temperature high/low, and day
 * Configurable watchface with numerous display settings
 * Second hand shows battery level, and will sweep if 'Gold Inlay' and 'Precious Stones' are both set
 * Always on setting
 * Hypnosis tool
 * Wearable.DataApi
 * Wearable.MessageApi
 * Google Analytics tracking (including Advertising ID)
 * Google Cloud Messaging
 * Preference Injector library
 * Wear Preference Activity library
 * Web Browser Integration
 * Lint-Free Code
 * A Gradle build 'preprocessor' which permits #IFDEF 'flavor' and #IFDEF 'buildType' in Android Java code
